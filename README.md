## About the Video Course
This course sets out to supply new possibilities. You will cover many aspects of Spring Boots: some you may know, and some you probably never knew existed. This course will boost your skills and will let you explore best practices and techniques to help you improve your application development.
In this course, you'll learn to implement practical and proven techniques and adopt a quicker way to develop applications using Spring Boot. Each section covers techniques (with clear instructions) you can use to carry out different development tasks in a practical manner. We cover how to make your apps more maintainable, testable, fault-tolerant, and resilient.
By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and confidence to harness the Spring Boot tips, best practices, and techniques covered in the course to make your coding and app development projects achieve their maximum potential performance-wise.
